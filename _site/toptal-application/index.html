    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>It was July 2013. By then, I had been working in the software industry for networking giants like Cisco and Juniper for almost four years. It was a great job, many people’s dream job. I wrote some good code and earned good money. But there was something missing. I loved my job, but at the end of the day I still felt dissatisfied.</p>

<p>My first tryst with the mountains had been made much earlier, when I cycled 550 km from the sleepy town of Kullu in Himachal Pradesh to Leh, the capital of Ladakh. This nineteen day affair included passing through several high altitude passes and even cycling on the highest motor-able road in the world. I had fallen in love with the Mountains. I promised myself I will be back to the mountains at least once an year. This time, I went ahead with a two week trip to the remote valleys of Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. The trip was not life changing, but it gave me a lot of time to think about what I want and where I want my career to head. By the time I was back in Bangalore, India’s silicon valley certain things were clear. I had got to know myself better - I did not enjoy being in crowded places, I did not enjoy living in the concrete jungles that the metros are, I did not think it was great to buy a posh house and spend the rest of the life paying the EMIs. I did not want to get back to the software job I had. Don’t get me wrong, I still loved writing software. It was one of the things I enjoyed and was good at, but just loving the job wasn’t enough. I realized that the everyday commute would drain me out. I still remember getting into the city traffic the first day after I got back from my trip and thinking life cannot be just this. I would spend about an hour and a half to get to office everyday. That meant I was spending fifteen hours a week just for getting to office and back. I could rent a place nearby to reduce the commute time, but that would mean I was living in a ‘not so great’ locality, and my social life would get affected. Being born and brought up in Mysore, a quiet town, I was longing to get back my hometown.</p>

<p>I finally quit my job at Juniper networks in November 2013 and moved back to my hometown. I joined a travel startup, goMowgli travels and traveled for the next year in Karnataka, Kerala and Goa. I was the product head in my company, which meant I had the responsibility of coming up with the entire product. This included deciding what places our company would take the customers to, what off-beat experiences we recommend them to try, which accommodations give the most satisfying stay options. We built partnerships with activity and accommodation providers. At the end of my tenure, I had built a solid product for the company. I had also got back to the mountainspa a lot more. The most memorable one was the chadar trek, walking on a frozen river in extreme cold. I also completed my Basic Mountaineering Course from Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, one of the most prestigious Mountaineering institutes in India.</p>

<p>As I wrap up my work with goMowgli, I have a question in my mind, what next? I know deep down, that I want to get back to software and work on some great products. But I am also sure I do not want to move back to the chaos that Bangalore is. And that’s when it all fell into place. Remote jobs. I could get to work on the most challenging technologies, from the comforts of my home. I could travel as I want, spend six months in the Alps and another six in South Africa, still doing what I love, writing some good code. Toptal offers just that, remote jobs that provide me with challenging work and the flexibility that does not tie me to a 9-5 office desk job. It helps me find a good job and ensure my skills are being utilized at the right place. It selects only the best, making sure I am in elite company. It is the perfect solution for people like me and I am hoping for some great years at toptal.</p>
