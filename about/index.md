I am Megha, a girl from the small town of Mysore, India. 

###Things I care about in no particular order 

* Technology - I love the way technology can affect our lives. From simple apps to complex projects, it changes the way we live.

* Mysore - I love where I stay. I hated living in a metropolitan city and moved back to my hometown more than two years ago, no regrets whatsover.

* Ultimate Frisbee - [A small introduction to the game I love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEKnqFBajiI). It helps me keep fit, and get better as a person. Win - win.

* Women Empowerment - I am a feminist at heart.

* Health Food - Slowly becoming a fan of Organic healthy food. They say, you are what you eat ;)

* Adventure - I love being outdoors. Himalayas are the annual piligrimage I have to undertake and I have trekked, backpacked and cycled there. I have also completed a Basic Mountaineering Course from the Nehru Mountaineering Institute.
